<p class="ex1" style="margin-left:20rem;margin-right20rem,max-width;50%"> My name is Ayoub. I got into photography in 2019 when I bought my professional camera, a Sony A6400, which I still use to this day. I have since upgraded my lens and tremendously upgraded my knowledge. I started off with making youtube videos for myself, but then once I was making music I thought that I could make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pieshelpfuloven2864">music videos</a> for myself and for friends, which I did. Currently, I am working on creating MACE, a spicy preworkout, and in that process I have been making <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gorillagarnish/">gym videos and edits</a> and that is when I started TampaShutter too.
